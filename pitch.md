## Integrating AI and applying AI to data is a huge challenge

The AI lifecycle is highly complex, interdependent but fragmented.

![center](images/workflow_logos.svg)

---

## Current solutions don’t enable efficient interoperability between data and models 

- Data preparation and processing causes huge overhead 
- No intelligent information lookup on the fly by the model
- No handling of new data points (streaming)

---

## Companies do not own their data and AI

**Companies want**

- 100% control over their infrastructure and deployments
- To avoid vendor lock-in by cloud and SaaS providers
- Transparency & auditability over what happens with their data

---

# Data and AI need to be fully united in order to maximize their value

---

# SuperDuperDB

### The first fully fledged AI-database solution

---

## SuperDuperDB: Integrating AI directly into your database

### Uniting best in class database and deep learning software

![center w:700](images/connector.svg)

---

## A solution for data scientists designed by data scientists

### SuperDuperDB allows full flexibility and maximal agility

- Train and develop arbitrary AI models without infrastructural overhead.
- Deploy live AI models to the database to give unprecendented data navigation 
and comprehension.

---

## SuperDuperDB is a unified environment for the entire AI-data workflow

### Computation of new output happens directly on the data - outputs are stored directly with the input data

![center w:900](images/cycle-linear.svg)

---

## SuperDuperDB minimizes overhead and revolutionizes AI capabilities

- Complex data preparation and processing is no longer required
- AI models can perform entirely new operations by having access to all data 
- AI can handle new incoming data and streaming

---

## SuperDuperDB will allow companies to fully own their AI and data stack

### The SuperDuperDB core codebase will be open sourced under Apache License 2.0

- Companies will be able to deploy their AI and models in a unified way in their own data centers.
- Their entire stack will be transparent and no longer locked in behind SaaS and cloud providers.

---

## Example: with SuperDuperDB instantly deploy a full-stack of e-Commerce AI

<!-- (*Write e-commerce stuff in the boxes*) -->
