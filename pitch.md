## Problem: Integrating AI and applying AI to data is a huge challenge

<div class="columns">
<div style="margin-top: 10%;">

The AI lifecycle is highly complex, interdependent but fragmented.
Various stages in the lifecycle are supported by distinct competing
providers.

Huge overhead because different workflows and tooling fragmented.

## Problem: Traditional AI is not able to work directly with incoming information

<div class="columns">
<div style="margin-top: 5%;">

**New models can now do these things:**

- Search semantically for new information streaming live
- Handle unseen datapoints 
- Lookup information in databases
- Synthesise output based on information found in a database
